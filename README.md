Opencart Blank Theme
====================

What is the point of it ?
-------------------------

This blank theme is created to make theming for opencart easier for frontend developers and designers. It makes the code easier to read with indentation (and tabs god dammit) and re-aranges the css to be easier to override it.

What is done ?
--------------

Indentation done in :
- template/common/*
- template/account/*
- template/affiliate/*
